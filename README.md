# Heart Disease Prevention - Capstone Project

## Overview

This project explores patterns in patient health data to support heart disease prevention strategies. By applying descriptive, segmentation, and inferential statistical techniques, we aim to identify key risk factors and propose data‑driven preventive measures.

## Dataset

The dataset contains medical records of patients, including variables such as:

* **Age**, **Sex**, **Chest Pain Type (cp)**, **Fasting Blood Sugar (fbs)**, **Cholesterol**, **Resting Blood Pressure**, **Max Heart Rate**, **ST Depression (oldpeak)**, and more.  
* The target variable is **diagnosis** (1 = heart disease present, 0 = no heart disease).

## Objectives

* **Descriptive Statistics** – Understand the distribution of key features and highlight significant differences between healthy and at‑risk individuals.  
* **Segmentation** – Categorize patients into meaningful groups based on risk factors to assist with tailored preventive care.  
* **Inferential Statistics** – Test hypotheses to validate observed patterns and ensure statistical significance in differences across groups.  

## Key Sheets

* `Data` – Cleaned dataset used for analysis.  
* `Data_Sick` & `Data_Healthy` – Subsets of patients for comparative analysis.  
* `1 - Descriptive stats` – Exploratory statistics and visual summaries.  
* `2 - Segmentation` – Risk‑based clustering or grouping of patients.  
* `3 - Inferential stats` – Hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.  

## Tools Used

* **Excel** – Data cleaning, analysis, and visualization  
* **Statistical Methods** – T‑tests, frequency analysis, segmentation logic  

## Insights

This project provides practical, data‑driven insights to healthcare practitioners on identifying early signs of heart disease and crafting prevention plans for high‑risk populations.
